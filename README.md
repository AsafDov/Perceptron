# Perceptron
My very first perceptron project


A perceptron is the unique idea of simulation of single neurons.
This demonstration shows the power of solving linearly solvable problems by creating a "Single Neuron Brain".

The training data is a set of 2D points ranging from -1 to 1. 
The Perceptron is able to converge on zero mistakes after only 10 "examples"

I love this idea, and its definitly a steping stone towards the more complex idea of nerual networks.
